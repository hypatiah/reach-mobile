# Reach
An application to preset and send text messages so that in a time of crisis a user simply opens the application and taps ‘REACH’ to notify their support network.
Reach enables users to reach out before talking themselves out of seeking help. 

Reach is built in mobile with React Native and a Ruby on Rails backend.
